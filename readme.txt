WPMktgEngine turns your WordPress site into a marketing engine for your business.  A comprehensive online marketing platform.


== Description ==
A full integrated online marketing application. Combines the flexibility of WordPress with the power of email marketing, smart rule automation, lead generation and lead management. Experience amazing results!

With the WPMktgEngine plugin installed, customers  using WordPress as their website platform can now:

- Generate more leads using our drag-and-drop PageBuilder & landing page capability (no web dev techie required)
- Automate email marketing and lead nurturing based on site visitor actions
- Create content-relevant and buyer-stage calls-to-action (CTAs) and insert them on pages, into posts, or in sidebars - without having to create multiple sidebars! You place CTAs wherever they make the most sense based on your content.
- CTAs can be images that change on mouse-over, or HTML buttons - your choice.
- All leads are stored in your WPMktgEngine's account centralized lead database / CRM (in the cloud), so it's kept safe and doesn't add any overhead to your WordPress hosting account.
- Track all visitor activity and record it into the lead's Activity screen inside the centralized lead database.
- Integrate WordPress user levels with WPMktgEngine Lead Types - automatically - and then use Smart Rules to trigger messages and create deeper engagement.
- Understand who are your subscribers and approved commenters and add them to your lead database automatically.  Know which leads are leaving comments on your blog, which subscribers are active, and nurture them with more relevant content.
- Create and manage forms with WPMktgEngine and present them in your WordPress site using one of our form themes or your site's default form CSS - use for calls-to-action, event registrations, and more - as popups or full forms -and the forms are responsive too.
- Form submissions on WordPress automatically create or update lead records in the centralized lead database - trigger automatic emails, nurturing sequences, or a variety of other activities.
- Your Centralized lead database lives in the cloud, so it doesn’t bog down your WordPress implementation at all.  Your data is safe and secure - available from any installed WPMktgEngine plugin across one or more of your sites (depending upon which level of WPMktEngine you have).

With the WPMktgEngine Plugin, your site will engage visitors, entice them to provide their contact informaton, and increase your audience - which means, ultimately, that you will increase your sales!  View more at: http://wpmktgengine.com.

Approved commenters will be pushed across in real time to your WPMktgEngine account, as comments are approved).  Understanding which leads are commenting in addition to all their other activity is now seamless!
